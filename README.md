Based on my previous projects I needed a customized RPI4 carrier board with 2 cameras input. The initially idea was taken from this project: https://www.tindie.com/products/dronecz/minimal-carrier-board-for-compute-module-4/.

I made several changes such as, 4 layer PCB, added second camera lanes, differential routing for both cameras and HDMI, added temperature sensor, added I2C and UART additional connectors.

I have added also two jumpers that allow disabling wireless and bluetooth. I have tested nearly every connection. SD card connector does not work if you are using RPI4CM with emmc. 

In general, I am quite happy with the setup. JLCPCB manifactured and assembeled most of the parts. However, one board did not have Hirose connectors soldered properly, I have received a coupon. I have not touched the spacing for Hirose connectors, but I found it maybe slightly off. It is hard to connect RPI for the first time. But I dont want to modify it as it is working for several weeks.
